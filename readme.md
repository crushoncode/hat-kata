# Summary of TDD Workshop

I have invited two mentors and four classmates to my home lounge to run a mentoring session. It is for the practice of Test-Driven Development in JavaScript. We have worked on the hat kata and understood how testing works and what needs to be more improved in our code. Each person took their turn every 10 minutes for 1.5 hours. Mob programming has allowed us to expand our ideas by sharing different thoughts and knowledge and also going through refactoring together. 

## Attendee
